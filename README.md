Let's take a look at the directions for this week's assignment: [XXX](XXX)

### :thinking: Questions 

Use this time to answer students questions from the lesson materials and assignments. Remember to incorporate teaching strategies: 

  - **Think aloud**: Narrate your thinking to show students how developers approach problems. For example, ‚ÄúWhen I saw this problem, I decided to approach it by‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - Use **positive narration**. For example, ‚ÄúI appreciate that Raheem has his camera on today‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat was an excellent question."
  - **Warm call** on students or **practice popcorn calling** (students can ask another student for help) if participation is low.

### :telescope: Looking Ahead

Please remember to fill out the [Mentor Session Report Form](https://airtable.com/shrp0jjRtoMyTXRzh) at the end of the session.

## Common Issues 

In the first mentor session, one of your main goals should be establishing rapport with students. Focus on creating a space where it's ok to ask for help or be wrong. Remind students that professional developers need to get help all the time.
