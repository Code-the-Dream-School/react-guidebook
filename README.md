# React Guidebook

This repository contains teaching notes, rubrics, and other resources for volunteers in Code the Dream's Ruby on Rails classes.

To use these resources, navigate to the branch that corresponds with this week's lesson. Teaching notes (along with a sample mentor session outine) for each week are found in the readme file. Sample code is found under each branch.
  - teaching notes have general observations, topics to focus on, and sample discussion topics. 
  - teaching notes also make note of any confusing instructions 
  - check the teaching notes and rubrics for a guide to what students' projects should be doing at the end of each lesson.
