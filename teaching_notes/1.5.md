## Outline

- Overview
- Sample Mentor Session
- Common Issues

## Overview

**Learning Objective:** Students will be able to save the to-do list in their local browser; create custom hooks

## :wave: Check-In

### Check-In Open-Ended Questions

- Start with an icebreaker from this [icebreaker list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WbwKn8B5GfRueq7Zbw0zx_k15aqyIqIs23i_WHI-pPI/edit?usp=sharing).
- What is something that you are excited to learn more about this week?

### Check-In Progress Poll

- What is your progress on **this week's** materials?

  - [ ] Done
  - [ ] Almost Done
  - [ ] Halfway
  - [ ] Just started
  - [ ] Haven't started

While students are responding to the check-in questions, take attendance.

### :mag: Content Overview

Let's review some key terms and concepts from this week's lesson materials:

- Side-effects
- Custom hooks
- React fragments

- Need way for the React app to interact with the outside world
  - CRUD data from API
  - Interact with browser storage (Cookies, SessionStorage, IndexedDb, etc.)
  - Interact with DOM outside of using React (some 3rd party libraries need to directly manipulate the DOM)
- Consists of 2 parts
  - function that does work
  - array of state values to listen to
    - when any of the values listed change, useEffect re-runs
    - empty array will run only when component mounts
    - no array means effect will run every time component renders
- Always runs when component mounts (explain React 18's x2 mount)
- multiple useEffect can be used

#### Custom hooks

- don't call hooks from normal function
  - can be called in highest level of functional component
  - can be called inside another hook
  - eslint-plugin-react-hooks can lint for violations

### React fragments

- JSX restricts return statements to return only a single top-level dom element.
- Up until now, you've been wrapping things in a div or some other single element
- Fragment allows the developer to return multiple dom elements on the same level
- longhand: `<React.Fragment><bunch/><of/><sibling/><elements/><React.Fragment />`
- shorthand is `<><bunch/><of/><sibling/><elements/></>`
- "disappears" when the JSX renders out HTML

### Potential concept demo ideas

- demo useEffect's optional array
  - empty
  - one, multiple values
  - no array
- show how fragments disappear
- make a custom hook

### :notebook: Assignment Overview

### Side-effects

### Todo list instructions call-outs

- The custom hook is a leap of logic and may require additional hand-holding

### End of lesson app capabilities/features

- app loads saved todos from local storage
- can add new items which automatically get saved back

### :thinking: Questions

Use this time to answer students questions from the lesson materials and assignments. Remember to incorporate teaching strategies:

- Think aloud: Narrate your thinking to show students how developers approach problems. For example, “When I saw this problem, I decided to approach it by…”
- Use positive narration. For example, “I appreciate that Raheem has his camera on today” or “That was an excellent question."
- Warm call on students or practice popcorn calling (students can ask another student for help) if participation is low.
